# Woff Viewer 

Available at [http://www.tmroyal.com/woff-viewer/](http://www.tmroyal.com/woff-viewer/)

This is a basic web application that allows a user to view glyphs from a woff or woff2 webfont.

The user chooses a web font on their hard drive, and then the app displays all of the selected glpyhs for that font. 

I am proud of the functionality of this, but would like to revisit it in order to clean the code a bit. I also would like to enable to loading of woff's from CDN's and the like.
